<p>Welcome to Lambda Continuum. This is a space where I explore my diverse interests, with a particular focus on analytic philosophy and computer science. Content here will span from explorations of formal philosophy to practical technical discussions, with the occasional unserious post. These entries will act as both a personal reference library for the future and a means for solidifying my thoughts on various subjects. Personal experience has shown me that the act of writing for purposes of explaining to others leads to greater understanding of the material. Additionally, having these explanations documented will provide a valuable resource to return to as my knowledge and perspectives evolve or as I inevitably forget stuff.</p>
<p>I cross post a lot of my articles here to substack if you&rsquo;d rather follow me over there.</p>
