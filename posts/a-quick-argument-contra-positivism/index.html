<p>Logical Positivism commits one to the thesis that meaningful thought is verifiable. An entailment of such a thesis is that all true propositions, in principle, are verifiable and therefore knowable. Here’s a short argument from Fitch’s Knowability Paradox that serves to prove positivism incorrect.</p>
<p>Assume, for reductio, that we know there are truths that no one knows and consider an epistemic logic that is at least system K4D:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>K(P ∧ ¬KP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since our logic extends K, K(P ∧ ¬KP) ⊨ KP ∧ K¬KP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By (2), KP ⊨ KKP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This implies KKP ∧ K¬KP, which contradicts D.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, we have derived a contradiction from our assumption, meaning it is impossible for the assumption to be true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, ¬◊K(P ∧ ¬KP), that is, there are truths that are impossible to know.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since we’ve demonstrated certain truths are impossible to know, one must either:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reject the assumption that there are truths we do not know,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reject the 4 and D, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reject the notion that all true propositions are unknowable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Option (1) is untenable as there are obviously truths we don’t know. Option (2) also doesn’t seem viable, if you know that P you know that you know that P (i.e. axiom 4) and if you know P you don’t know not P (i.e. axiom D) seem intuitive. The only option is to accept option (3) which contradicts positivism.</p>
