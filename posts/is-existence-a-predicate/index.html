<p>You hear this argument frequently when discussing the ontological argument for God. The theist may claim that existence is a perfection, while the skeptic counters by arguing that perfections must be properties and to be a property one must be able to predicate it of an object. However, ‘existence is not a predicate,’ merely a prerequisite for properties.</p>
<p>Okay, but what exactly does it mean for existence to be (or not to be) a predicate? To me it seems unclear between various interpretations.</p>
<p>It is trivial to construct a first-order monadic predicate, termed ‘exists,’ such that exists := λx (∃y y = x). This ‘exists’ predicate is true of and only of things that exist and will abide by the syntactic rules of a predicate in first-order logic. So, why would it be incorrect to say that existence is a predicate?</p>
<p>Well, the dictum that existence isn’t a predicate originates with Kant, and he was writing before the progress in a logic of quantification that Frege, Russell, Quine, and others contributed to. It’s reasonable to assume that when Kant claimed existence isn’t a predicate, he meant something different.</p>
<p>There are a few possible things Kant may have had in mind when he said that existence isn&rsquo;t a predicate.</p>
<p>At the time, traditional formal logic was relegated to Port Royal and Aristotelian syllogism. Such formal logic viewed existence as explicated in terms of copulas like &lsquo;is&rsquo; or &lsquo;are.&rsquo; Consider traditional examples of syllogistic logic, such as &lsquo;Socrates is a man&rsquo; or &lsquo;Men are mortal.&rsquo; If these sentences are true, they imply that both men and Socrates exist. So, existence is not a real predicate but is merely derivatively implied by the copula. Existence is merely a matter of the logic of the copula. He may also have meant that, whereas conceiving of a red apple adds something to the concept of an apple, conceiving of an existing apple doesn’t add anything because the mental images of an existing apple and a non-existing apple are the same. Thus, existence isn’t a predicate.</p>
<p>But in both cases, when Kant says that existence isn’t a predicate, he seems to be addressing something very different from what someone who constructs the predicate above is claiming. When Kant says existence isn’t a predicate, he is suggesting that within the framework of Aristotelian syllogistic logic, existence isn’t a predicate or that existence does not “add” to the concept of a thing. Meanwhile, those who endorse the trivial construction are simply asserting that a predicate named &rsquo;existence&rsquo; can be constructed in a predicate logic, which is true only of existing things. They are addressing two different questions.</p>
<p>Let’s take someone from a post-Frege world of logic. Gilbert Ryle denies that existence is a predicate. What does he mean? The idea is that existence differs significantly from other ordinary terms used in the predicate position. Consider the following sentences:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>‘Brown cows exist.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Purple cows don’t exist.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Brown cows flourish.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Purple cows don’t flourish.’</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea is that we are systematically misled into treating sentences like (1) and (2) analogously to (3) and (4) due to superficial grammatical resemblance, since &rsquo;exists&rsquo; appears in the predicate position. However, there is a major difference between existence claims and other predicate claims, such as &lsquo;flourish.&rsquo; The former are translatable into quantificational sentences like &lsquo;Some cows are brown&rsquo; and &lsquo;It is false that some cows are purple.&rsquo; In translation, the word &rsquo;exists&rsquo; disappears from the predicate position, with its function being accomplished by the quantifier. In contrast, ordinary predicates like &lsquo;flourish&rsquo; and &lsquo;red&rsquo; are genuine predicates, as they cannot be translated into sentences where they no longer take a predicate position. The idea is that every existence claim is merely a covert quantificational claim, and hence &rsquo;exists&rsquo; is a bogus predicate. The proper role of existence is played by quantification and not predication.</p>
<p>If this is what’s at dispute, then it’s not even clear that Ryle disagrees with someone who claims existence is a predicate because they can construct a &rsquo;exists&rsquo; predicate. What’s actually in contention is whether or not it is a &lsquo;genuine&rsquo; predicate. One could endorse that &rsquo;exists&rsquo; is a predicate but not a &rsquo;true&rsquo; predicate in the sense that Ryle describes.</p>
<p>It seems to me that asking whether existence is a predicate is essentially pointless without further clarification of what is meant when one asks.</p>
