<p>Consider the following argument:</p>
<ol>
<li>If God exists then God would tell you to two-box.</li>
<li>If God exists then everything God recommends to do is rational to do.</li>
<li>Therefore, If God exists then God would tell you to two-box and everything God recommends to do is rational to do. (From 1 and 2),</li>
</ol>
<p>(2) is surely uncontroversial, an all good, all powerful, and all knowing being tells me that that some action is rational I&rsquo;m almost certain that it is. (1) seems to just be a variant of the well wishing friend argument George Schlesinger provides. If you have a friend that wants the best for you, knows the content of the opaque box, and they&rsquo;re given the option to recommend what you should do, they&rsquo;re always going to recommend you take both boxes. Now presumably God both wants the best for you and knows the content of the opaque box. So God would recommend two-boxing.</p>
<p>So either two-boxing is rational in Newcomb&rsquo;s problem or God doesn&rsquo;t exist. A corollary of this is that the various arguments for God (Modal ontological arguments, contingency arguments, fine-tuning arguments) are arguments for two-boxing and the various arguments for one-boxing (Why Aincha&rsquo; Rich?) are arguments for the non-existence of God.</p>
